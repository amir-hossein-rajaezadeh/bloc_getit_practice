# movie_app

A movie app Project

Movie app project that connects to API and has list of movies, genres, search movie, and also movies in different genres.
This project is based on flutter_bloc(cubit) and retrofit as client manager (handle GET and POST methods).
You can create your movie  and upload image of movie in /screens/add_movie_page.dart and search it.

API link is:
http://moviesapi.ir/



The Design of the project is a dribbble shot(some additional pages have been designed by myself because those pages like genre list or latest movies or movie photos weren't on that dribble shot).

And last but not least, on the movie detail page you see 2 tabs(Actors and writers) that has a list of actors and writers, those actor and writer images are not real, and the list of images that placed in utils/image_list.dart file.
